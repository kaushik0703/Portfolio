# Portfolio Website with React.js and Three.js

## Introduction
Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio. I created this site using React and Three.js, two awesome libraries for building interactive web applications. On this site, you can see some of my projects, skills, and hobbies. I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and learning more about me.
 
I've use following frameworks while doing this project:
- ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
- React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
- TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
- Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations

While doing this project I've:
- Load, create and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
- Made use of reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices
- Ensure responsiveness across all devices and improve your site's performance using Suspense and Preload.
